            <h3>Maintenance</h3>
            <p>To ensure maximum efficiency and the longevity of your units you must maintain and have them cleaned on a regular basis. General filter cleans are a necessity to keep the recycled air in your home clean. With dust and other unhealthy particles, you or your family could risk breathing in small particles of mould and dirt in your lungs. This is especially hazardous for those with breathing related health issues or prone to air-born allergies. Keep it clean and stay healthy. </p>
            <p>Your air-conditioning unit can become quite dirty within 12 months or even less; thereby not providing you with the same fresh clean air you have become accustomed to. Moreover, your electricity bill also gets higher as the unit has to work significantly harder which can shorten the efficiency and the life of the air-conditioner. We clean all brands of air-conditioners in residential and commercial settings to the highest professional standards.</p>

      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Gill Air is a Brisbane based Air-Conditioning company. Our team of qualified Tradesman have been providing Air-Conditioning solutions for over 10 years. We are efficient, dedicated and experienced. We Know how to deliver projects that are solution-driven which result in cutting edge outcomes, our main focus is sustainability, professionalism and affordability for our clients.</p>
      <p>As many of you might be aware, there are many refrigerants, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that severely damage the ozone layer, whilst other refrigerant gases are often dangerous and extremely potent greenhouse gases. In fact, one kilogram of the refrigerant R410a has the same greenhouse impact as two tonnes of carbon dioxide, which is the equivalent of running your car for six months. At Gill Air, we take climate change very seriously. We aim for best business practices and remain vigilant to all industry standards when working with harmful refrigerant gases. </p>

          <p>The gentleman from GillAir found time in his busy schedule to come round
          to repair an air-conditioning unit in my young childs room. He
          highlighted and resolved issues from a previous installation free of
          charge. I highly recommend their services.</p>
